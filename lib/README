This directory contains jar files needed by WSDL2Java utility to regenerate helper classes 
in case of evolution of the OK Tech WS WSDL 

It contains also the required gson-xxx.jar file used when building this project. I do hope that
the latest from http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ does not break things...
